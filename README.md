# MovieApp

This is a movie app that I made for a school project alone. We were later divided into groups. With the group, we created an end version of this app that is available in an enterprise github account.

It manages to retrieve genre id and string from TheMovieDB, which will later be used to get a list of movies within that genre (This is not implemented in this version).

Here the app extracts a list of top 20 movies from TheMovieDB, but lacks detail view in this version.


PS There is also no search function in this app, but will later be implemented.
